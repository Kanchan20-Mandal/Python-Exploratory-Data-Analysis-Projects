# EDA Projects:
• Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset using Python, 
Pandas, and Matplotlib to gain insights into the characteristics of different iris 
species. 
• Analysed the distribution and relationships of key features such as sepal 
length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to understand their impact 
on iris species classification. 
• Visualized key patterns and trends in the dataset through histograms, scatter 
plots, and box plots, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the data.
